Description: This is a package to visualize risk prediction models.  For each
    predictor, a color bar represents the contribution to the linear predictor
    or latent variable.  A conversion from the linear predictor to the
    estimated risk or survival is also given.  (Cumulative) contribution charts
    enable to visualize how the estimated risk for one particular observation
    is obtained by the model. Several options allow to choose different color
    maps, and to select the zero level of the contributions.  The package is
    able to deal with 'glm', 'coxph', 'mfp', 'multinom' and 'ksvm' objects.  For 'ksvm'
    objects, the visualization is not always exact.  Functions providing tools
    to indicate the accuracy of the approximation are provided in addition to
    the visualization.
